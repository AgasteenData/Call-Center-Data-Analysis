# Call Center Data Analysis Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze call center data to derive key performance insights. The analysis helps in understanding caller behavior, call success rates, revenue generation, and country-wise trends. These insights assist in improving customer service, optimizing call handling strategies, and boosting revenue. Additionally, a **Power BI dashboard** has been created for visualization, and **Power BI Server** is used for deployment.

## Dataset Overview
- The dataset contains call records with details such as call status, revenue, and caller information.
- The data is stored in a table named **Book1**.

## Key Analysis & Insights
- **Call Volume & Revenue Metrics**
  - Total number of calls made.
  - Minimum, average, and maximum revenue values.
  - Total revenue generated by the call center.

- **Caller Analysis**
  - Unique number of callers.
  - Distribution of calls by status (RnR, Connected).
  - Percentage of successful (Connected) and unsuccessful (RnR) calls.

- **Geographical Insights**
  - Revenue distribution per country.

## SQL Queries Used
- Aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`).
- Grouping (`GROUP BY`) to analyze call statuses and country-wise revenue.
- Percentage calculations for call success rates.

## Power BI Implementation
- **Dashboard:** Created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize key metrics and trends.
- **Deployment:** The dashboard is deployed using **Power BI Server** for easy access and real-time updates.
- **Visualization Features:**
  - KPI metrics for total calls, revenue, and caller distribution.
  - Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for trend analysis.
  - Filters and drill-down options for deeper insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Database:** SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI
- **Deployment:** Power BI Server

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured analysis of call center operations, helping organizations improve customer interactions and revenue generation. The **Power BI dashboard** enhances data visualization, making insights more accessible and actionable. Future enhancements could include deeper segmentation, predictive analytics, and customer retention strategies.

## Usage
- Run the provided SQL queries on a compatible database system to generate insights from your call center data.
- Open the Power BI dashboard to explore interactive visualizations and key performance indicators.
